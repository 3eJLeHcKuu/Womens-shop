Layout of the initial pages of a women's clothing website. Here you can select the product you like, add it to the cart, in the upper right corner you can open the cart and see your added products, which can be deleted as needed, and the amount of selected products is also calculated separately. You can also use the call order function, which will open a new window for you. You can also open the product in a separate window and add it to your cart directly from there. The layout was recreated by transferring props into separate files with functionality.
